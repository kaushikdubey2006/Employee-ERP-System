🔹 Idea Overview – Employment Verification ERP

This idea focuses on creating a centralized digital platform where companies maintain verified employment records of their employees in a structured and secure way.

Instead of employees repeatedly collecting documents from previous companies, all important details—such as experience, role, duration of employment, salary proof, basic performance summary, and official documents—are verified once by the company and stored digitally.

Employees can view their complete profile, raise corrections if any data is wrong, and control whether their data can be shared.
When the employee moves to a new company, the next employer gets read-only access (only with employee consent) to these verified records, making hiring faster and more reliable.

The platform reduces:

Document delays

Manual HR verification calls

Fake experience issues

Stress faced by employees during job changes

Overall, it works like a digital employment passport + ERP system, benefiting both companies and employees while ensuring privacy, transparency, and compliance.
