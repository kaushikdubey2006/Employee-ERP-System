# Employee-ERP-System🔹 Idea Overview: Enterprise Employment Verification ERP

This idea proposes a centralized, secure employment verification platform where companies and employees both maintain verified digital profiles.

Each company acts as an administrator for its employees and uploads verified records such as employment duration, role, experience, salary proof, performance summaries, and official documents.
Employees can view their complete profile, raise disputes if data is incorrect, and control visibility for future employers.

When an employee switches jobs, the next company gets read-only access (with employee consent) to the verified profile.
This eliminates manual HR calls, document chasing, fake experience issues, and delays in salary or relieving documents.

The system also allows employees to rate and give structured feedback about companies (salary delays, document issues, work culture), while companies maintain compliance, audit logs, and legal safeguards.

Overall, the platform works like an ERP + digital employment passport, ensuring:

Faster hiring

Higher trust

Strong data security

Real relief to employees

Reduced operational load for companies

The current version is a frontend proof-of-concept, designed to validate usability, logic, and enterprise adoption before building backend, security, and integrations.
